# GitMistakes

A collection of mistakes I saw in repositories around the Internet that I hope we could avoid.

### 1. Short, undescriptive commit messages

#### Why is it mistake

One of the advantages of using Git is being able to see history of all changes in your repository. Having descriptive clear commit message makes it easy to navigate in history and track changes.

#### How to avoid it

Try to explain what was changed in your commit in 80 characters.

#### Examples
