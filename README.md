# GitMistakes

A collection of mistakes I saw in repositories around the Internet that I hope we could avoid.

### 1. Short, undescriptive commit messages

#### Why is it mistake

One of the advantages of using Git is being able to see history of all changes in your repository. Having descriptive clear commit message makes it easy to navigate in history and track changes.

#### How to avoid it

Try to explain what was changed in your commit in 80 characters.

#### Examples

- [cec5f10](https://github.com/MunGell/GitMistakes/commit/cec5f1038b4f2e714324d914520b74bf6ecaae31)
- [33c719a](https://github.com/MunGell/GitMistakes/commit/33c719aa18c98fbbac3f70b07a5f802e13a38ddf)

### 2. Documentation in commit messages

#### Why is it mistake

Almost opposite to the previous point â€“ documenting code or changes in commit messages. Commits contain very time-specific information, while documentation is relevant for a much longer period. There are not many people who like to go through a long list of commits to find description of a function or class.
